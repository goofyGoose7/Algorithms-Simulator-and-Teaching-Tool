# Algorithms-Simulator-and-Teaching-Tool
## ✨ hello ✨

This is my **OCR A-Level Computer Science NEA** (coursework) that received a **full marks score** of 70/70. It simulates the following algorithms: 
- Bubble Sort
- Prim's algorithm
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Simplex algorithm

It also has a **quiz section** that tests you on these.

## 👩‍💻 Overview
Most of the marks do come from the documentation, mine ended up being over 600 pages long (yes google docs was about to kill me).
Extensive sections on design, development and testing.
If you were to run it, run the main file (NEA_main_file.py) to start the program.

## ⚙️ Code stuff
In terms of actual code, the main libraries that need to be installed are: tkinter, matplotlib, heapq, sqlite3, numpy, networkx. 
All the database stuff is really basic with no security since this was not meant for real-world deployment.

---

## 😅 Known issues
Main issues that I gave up on fixing (for my sanity): 
  - Deleting vertices in the graph section errors sometimes.
  - Randomisation of questions involving graphs/plotted constraints makes some questions difficult to read and understand. Also sometimes the randomisation of constraints for the Simplex algorithm question could create questions that can't be solved.

## 🌸 Advice for A-Level CS Students
1. **REMEMBER this is MY project - please come up with your own idea!**
2.  MAKE YOUR PROJECT FEASIBLE IN THE TIME. I procrastinated and started properly coding mine during my Christmas holiday in Yr 13. I regretted it. Writing up and testing takes longer than you would expect so account for that if you want to be done with enough time to revise for your actual exams.
3. Stick to the code that you learn in the course - I chose to literally use Bubble Sort and Dijkstra's, which we study in the course, so that guaranteed that I would get those marks. If I were to go back, I would not have tried to code Simplex from scratch...
4. Justify EVERYTHING in your documentation to get those marks.
5. If you are running out of time, remember that nobody really reads everything you write.
6. Document as you code.
7. Label your code as you go so you can reference it in your testing tables.
8. In the design section, just convert some of your code into pseudocode once you have an idea of what you are doing. Just make it look like pseudocode.
9. It's okay to leave code that doesn't work, so long as you have documented it. Honestly it's good if it isn't 100% perfect since then you have stuff to write about in your limitations section of your evaluation
